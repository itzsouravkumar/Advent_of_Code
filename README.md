# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and have fun during the holiday season.

## Structure

Each day's solution is contained within its own directory, named `day_xx`, where `xx` is the day number (e.g., `DAY-1` for December 1st). Inside each directory, you will find subdirectories for each part of the puzzle, named `PART-1`, `PART-2`, etc. Inside each part directory, you will find:

- `code_1.py`: The solution code in python.
- `code_1.c`: The solution code in C.
- `code_1.txt`: The input data for the puzzle.
